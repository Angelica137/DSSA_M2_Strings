# Strings

1. Reverse strings
   
Write a function that tales a string as input and then returns the reversed string. 

For example, if the input is the string `"water"`, then the output should be `"retaw"`.

While you're working on the function and trying to figure out how to manipulate the string, it may help to use the `print` statement so you can see the effects of whatever you're trying.

Note - You can use built-in method `len()` on the string.

2. Anagrams

Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other. 
An anagram is a word (or phrase) that is formed by rearranging the letters of another word (or phrase).

For example:

- "rat" is an anagram of "art"
- "alert" is an anagram of "alter"
- "Slot machines" is an anagram of "Cash lost in me"

Your function should take two strings as input and return `True` if the two words are anagrams and `False` if they are not.

You can assume the following about the input strings:

- No punctuation
- No numbers
- No special characters

Note - You can use built-in methods `len()`, `lower()` and `sort()` on strings.


3. Reverse words

Given a sentence, reverse each word in the sentence while keeping the order the same!
