# Strings

1. Reverse strings
   
Write a function that tales a string as input and then returns the reversed string. 

For example, if the input is the string `"water"`, then the output should be `"retaw"`.

While you're working on the function and trying to figure out how to manipulate the string, it may help to use the `print` statement so you can see the effects of whatever you're trying.

Note - You can use built-in method `len()` on the string.
